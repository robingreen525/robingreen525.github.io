I am a first-year MD-PhD student at the University of Washington. My research interests focus on building algorithmic and statistical tools to learn about and combat disease. I'm currently working on ways to learn about infectious disease epidemiology by using genetic sequence data.

I graduated from Harvard College with a bachelor's degree in Applied Math in 2015. My research at the Harvard School of Public Health developed methods for learning about HIV dynamics from genetic sequence data, even when these data are incomplete. My work in Trevor Bedford's group will involve studying influenza rather than HIV, but will maintain a focus on phylodynamic methods.
